Class Readind Day 6

To make coding easier , fist we should understand what the problem is.

What is an object?
-Object is a group of variables and functions that create model in  real life. For example,
car is a object that has color, model ,type properties.it has also behavior that can be stoped, and drive.
var car{
  color:'red';
  model:' BMW X3';
  }
DOM(Document Object Model)
if we want to change behavior of existing functions or we want to change properties, we can initialize properties.After initialized the properties, we can instantiated with "new".
prototype-->we can think is a model of object.
this.-->access object properties inside the method.
DOM is a model of a web page and made of object.Each object refers to different part of web page.
DOM tree is made of node and each node refers to element of html.
We can access the element of dome tree by
--Single Node--
 --getElementById()
 --querySelector()
 --Multiple Node --
 --getElementByClassName()
 --getElementByTagName(h1)
 --querySelectorAll()
 ---moving between related element
 parentNode
 previousSibling/nextSbling
 firstChild/lastChild
We can work with DOM tree elements ,we can add a html elements to tree or  remove them.
